"""Bind each object id to one physical extent.

A language model emits a box per id per frame. When a small part rotates or
disappears into an assembly, the model often keeps the id and points it at a
larger neighbor of a similar color. The box then covers the neighbor. Extent
is what makes those boxes the same part or a different one: a part can be
partly covered and look smaller, and it can sit at a new angle, but it does
not become many times larger. A larger box is a different part. It is given
to the part whose established size it matches, or it is dropped.
